# AI Coding Comparison

The idea is to have a very simple app and codebase that everyone can 
understand.

Then have a list of common tasks on how to change and extend the codebase
with new features.

Record working on the common tasks with different AI IDEs and compare their
capabilities.

## Quick Start

- Install Go https://go.dev/doc/install
- Run `make` to run the application
